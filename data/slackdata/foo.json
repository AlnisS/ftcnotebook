        "text": "[12-11] Today we had some parts of the intake 3D printed. The bucket was being printed while I was there and Gilton was supposedly working on the marker. I was working on making the intake actually work, by drilling holes in the right places so we could attach a motor to run the surgical tubing. I did this successfully, with a little bit of fixing (we now have a sort of long hole) but it is functional. Daniel came up with another ingenious idea to make an adapter to the new surgical tubing bar: to make a part that starts out square for the vex motor hole, and then use prongs to snap into holes made on the bar.",
